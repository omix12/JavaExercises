### [Simple Chatty Bot](https://github.com/omix12/JavaExercises/tree/master/JetBrains%20Academy%20Projects/Simple%20Chatty%20Bot)

**About:**

Here, at the beginning of your programmer’s path, you will need a console bot that will guide you through the basics of software development. During this journey you will also play some word and number games that you are going to implement by yourself. Pack up and hit the road, my friend!

**Result:** 

As you move through the project, you’ll install Java on your machine and learn to work in a professional development environment. You’ll get to know the basic syntax of Java and write a simple program using variables, conditions, loops, and methods.
